### Goal
Develop a microscope that tracks single viruses in 3D while simultaneously imaging the surrounding cellular environment.

### Highlights
- Built a system that generates volumes with co-registered single-particle trajectories and 3D cellular imaging.
- Enabled observation of early virus–cell interaction dynamics (e.g., “skimming” behavior).
- Extended tracking to more complex live tissue-like systems.

### Outputs
- *Nature Methods (2022)*: Capturing the start point of the virus–cell interaction with high-speed 3D single-virus tracking.
