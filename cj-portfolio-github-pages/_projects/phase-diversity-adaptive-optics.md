### Goal
Develop a rapid, image-based adaptive optics approach broadly compatible across imaging modalities, enabling high-resolution imaging at depth in living samples.

### Highlights
- Built prototype microscopes from an empty optical table and tested feasibility of phase diversity methods.
- Extended the method to 3D samples and dual-view light-sheet configurations.
- Collaborated on deep neural network calibration of deformable mirror behavior, enabling computational aberration correction pathways.

### Outputs
- See publications: *Optica (2024)* and *DeepPD arXiv (2025)*.
