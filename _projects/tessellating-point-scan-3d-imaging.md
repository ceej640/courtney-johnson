### Overview
Increase volumetric imaging speed by using a tessellating scan pattern and optimized sparse sampling for point-scan microscopy.

### Highlights
- Developed theory for multi-dimensional scanning using tessellating patterns.
- Demonstrated faster 3D point-scan volumetric imaging compared to conventional z-stacks.
- Well-suited for integration with active-feedback tracking systems.

### Review
- Optics Express (2019): Continuous focal translation enhances rate of volumetric imaging.
- Frontiers in Optics (2019): Point-scan volumetric imaging rate increased by an optimized linear sparse sampling pattern.
