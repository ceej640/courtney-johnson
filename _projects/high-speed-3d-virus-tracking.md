### Overview
3D-Tracking and Imaging (3D-TrIm) is a microscope that tracks single viruses and other nanoparticles in 3D while simultaneously imaging the surrounding cellular environment in 3D.

### Highlights
- Built a system that generates volumes with co-registered single-particle trajectories and 3D cellular imaging.
- Enabled observation of early virus–cell interaction dynamics (e.g., “skimming” behavior).
- Extended tracking to more complex live tissue-like systems.
