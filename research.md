subtitle: Optical instrumentation and computational methods for biological imaging

## Research interests
My work sits at the intersection of **microscopy development**, **instrumentation**, and **image processing**. I build and refine imaging systems from the optical table up, and enhance them with computational methods to improve image quality and extract quantitative measurements. I am a strong proponent of "smart microscopy" and build with an automation-first mindset. Ultimately, I aim to build microscopes that are useful tools for biologists and not tech demos.

### Core themes
- **Advanced microscopy systems** (widefield, light-sheet, point-scan volumetric)
- **Adaptive optics and aberration correction**
- **Computational imaging and reconstruction**
- **Smart Microscopy**
- **Quantitative image analysis** for applied bio-imaging

### Collaboration
I enjoy interdisciplinary work that connects physics/engineering with biological applications—especially when the outcome is a tool that becomes broadly usable by others.
